#  Categories?
- Categories add new methods to existing classes - without subclassing
- In swift, it's called "class extension"
- Caveat: You cannot add data (fields, properties) to a class (onluy methods)

#  Naming Convention
- Naming Convention for file name: `ClassToExtend+CategoryName(.h, .m)`
- for example,

`NSString+WaterMark'
